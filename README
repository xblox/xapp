XApp-Connect-UI is currently hard coded into XApp-Studio but easy to deploy as stand-alone app or service.

Considerations

- Should only build configuration files as in JSON format
- Must run as stand-alone application, for instance as hybrid Mac-App
- Must run as offline-app
- Resulting configurations will be forwarded to a storage delegate or provider (Server, Node.js,...)
- Must be a single widget for being used in subviews



Use case 1 :

1.0 User registers a custom data type (SourceType) : "Articles"
1.1 The custom data type is mapped to a XApp-Connect-Type ('CustomType')
1.2 The XApp-Connect-Type is mapped to a service method (SMD), ie: "getArticles"
1.3 The service method wraps a generic JSON-RPC-Method which will send a query information
1.4 The query information contains a keyed set of queries and result-templates

XApp-Connect-UI must provide the UI for the complete procedure and return this data structure :

[1:n] - Custom-Type
[1:n] - Custom-Type to Service-Method Mappings
[1:n] - Service-Method
[1:n] - Query-Info
